# Loops, Tegan Robinson, v0.0

# TWO TYPES OF LOOPS
# for <-- Used when you know how many loops you'll need.
# while <-- Used when you do not know how many loops you'll need.

# for loop is like Go Fish, you search each card for what the player asked.
# while loop is like musical chairs, you move around until the music stops.

# EACH TRIP THROUGH THE ENTIRE LOOP IS CALLED AN iteration
# "iteration throught the list" means use a for loop

# for loop Example -- Iterating a List
fruits = ["apple", "bannana", "strawberry", "cherry"]
for eachFruit in fruits:
    print(eachFruit)

# continue Keyword -- Skips the current iteration and then finishes the loop.
fruits = ["apple", "bannana", "strawberry", "cherry"]    
for eachFruit in fruits:
    if eachFruit == "bannana":
    continue
    print(eachFruit)

   # continue Keyword -- Skips the current iteration and then finishes the loop.
fruits = ["apple", "bannana", "strawberry", "cherry"]    
for eachFruit in fruits:
    if eachFruit == "bannana":
    break
    print(eachFruit)
